This post is my take on displying real-time views using Firebase and React. This is previously done by Guillermo Rauch on [rauchg.com](https://rauchg.com) and Lee Robinson on [leerob.io](https://leerob.io).
Lee also explains how he did this in his [blog](https://leerob.io/blog/real-time-post-views).

So why should you read _my_ post if they have already done so and even explained it? The reason being, both of the implementations require some sort of node environment to execute code while my post shows how you can achieve it on the _client-side_.

Another reason being, both websites are using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) while mine is using [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and I couldn't find anything related to it. So here we are.

Let us begin then.
